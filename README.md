## Alzheimer’s disease detection using deep learning
 The project leverages the power of deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.The proposed methodology involves preprocessing the imaging data, training deep learning models, and optimizing hyperparameters to achieve the best classification performance. This work also highlights the importance of responsible AI in healthcare and encourages further research in this critical domain.

## About
A comprehensive approach Alzheimer's disease identifying is presented by combining Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While Recurrent Neural Networks perform effectively with sequential data, like the temporal patterns in patient records, Convolutional Neural Networks are better at image processing tasks, resulting in them useful in understanding brain scans. In this scenario, Convolutional Neural Networks have the ability to identify changes in the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease by retrieving spatial information from medical images. In addition, Recurrent Neural Networks are able to identify emerging patterns and subtle changes as time passes by collecting temporal dependencies in longitudinal patient data.

## Results and Impact
The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction project has resulted in the potential to revolutionize early detection and intervention methods for those at risk of Alzheimer's disease when it is implemented in real-life
situations. This research makes use of deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyze Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) and detect minute patterns that may be signs of Alzheimer's disease..
In the end, this project's practical implementation should improve Alzheimer's early diagnosis, leading to better patient outcomes and expanding our knowledge of this neurological disease.
